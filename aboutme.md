### my mission
My mission is to live in a way that I become the best version of myself. I follow this path and allow myself to dabble in any art or science that I feel the urge to try. Though unothrodox this philosophy has shaped my life into an unruly flow of experiences, crafting my world perspective. It is this interdisciplinary view that I impart into all of work.
