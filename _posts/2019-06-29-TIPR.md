 ## What's TIPR?
TIPR is Tokyo's Intermediate Power Ranking. A ranked ladder system founded by the Tokyo esports coomunity. 
Prior to TIPR the Super Smash Brothers competitive community lacked a way to track the achievements of players across tournaments.
The creation of TIPR allowed for seasonal rankings, and reenergized the community.

## My Role
When I heard about TIPR I was honored to be asked to do the artwork and lead the press campaign for the new ranked ladder system.
The ultimately successful campaign went on to unite six [Tokyo community tournies under the TIPR banner](https://twitter.com/TokyoSSB_JP)
