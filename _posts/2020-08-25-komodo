In a recent commission I was hired by a client to create a komodo dragon dual wielding the Monado Sword from Xenoblade Chronicles, and the Yato from Fire Emblem Fates. 
This commission came as shock to me because it was by the most wild and creative piece that anyone has asked me to illustrate. It goes without saying that enjoyed this project tremendously.
Here's to you Komodo, cheers!
