I was contacted by the author of *The Journal of Lincoln Studies* to commission a cover for the latest edition of the journal!
Needless to say I was very excited cooperate on this project, and I'm pretty proud of the end product.

## Look for it on a website near you!
 This edition of *The Journal of Lincoln Studies* will soon be available for purchase on [Amazon.com!](https://www.amazon.com)
