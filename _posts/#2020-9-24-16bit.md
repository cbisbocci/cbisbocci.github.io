The esports organization 16-Bit reached out to me to create a simple animation out of their existing logo in order to introduce their youtube videos and other social media creations.

## The Process
This project was unique in that I had to find a way to incorporate 16-Bit's logo into an animated introductory clip.
After drafting the initial sequences, I began asset creation of the game console and 16-bit background within Adobe Illustrator. 
From there I composed the assets and added sound effects in Adobe After Effects. 

16-Bit was pleased with how I managed to animate their logo into a succint introductory clip.
With permission, I uploaded the original intro to Youtube [here!](https://youtu.be/L1WP5hCgqpg).
