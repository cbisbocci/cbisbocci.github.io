As a freelance designer one of the most important parts of my job lies in practicing effective communication skills.
And through my past experience I have made collaborating with clients and small businesses my number one priority!
Below is a sample of work that I have done for a local business.

## E-Place
E-Place is a local English school that enlisted me to help them create a spot-the-differences poster for their Christmas campaign.
While working on this project my greatest struggle was to meld my artistic style with E-Place's vision for their campaign. 
However through my conversations with the E-Place team I was able to create a product that perfectly encapsulated their needs and met their seasonal deadline.

Can you spot all 10 differences?
