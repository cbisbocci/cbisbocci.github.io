In a mixed community of local and expatriate athletes is not uncommon for a player to relocate or return home.
This was always the hardest part of being an organizer in an esports community, and often there few words that could accurately communicate to our friend and fellow athlete that they would be sorely missed by the community. 

## The Saga Begins!
To commemorate the atheletes who would be leaving the family soon, I began hosting Sagas. A Saga is typically the last event a player will be able to attend. For this reason we made the event special by dedicating the tournament to that athlete and creating special art in their honor. Although creating fan art worthy of a sendoff for a friend is a daunting challenge, so I began to work with another artist in the community named [Big Toe](https://twitter.com/BigToeSSB). Together, Big Toe and I collaborated on a total of eight pieces to honor our friends that we had to say good-bye to. Below are a few of our proudest saga commemorations!
