Over the past week I conceived, designed, and published my concept for a series of mobile stickers. This series follows the adventures of an altogether adorable axolotl named Momo! Momo-kun was inspired by my pet axolotl. Whenever my friends would come to visit they would find him irresistably cute. This project became a way for me share my and my friend's love for Momo-kun via mobile services!  
  
  Momo-kun is now available for purchase in the [Official Line Store](https://store.line.me/stickershop/product/5175060/en) and will soon be available on Facebook! Below are some of Momo Kun's many faces:
