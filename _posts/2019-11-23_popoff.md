## What's POPOFF?
POPOFF! is a major Tokyo esporting event.
The event planned to accomodate 400 competitors from all parts of Japan and abroad to compete in a double-elimination Super Smash Brothers bracket. An event of this undertaking is huge, and I was asked to coordinate the social media campaign, as well as to design the official POPOFF! logo and social media campaing press kit.

## Designing POPOFF!
POPOFF is by far one of the projects that I had the most working on. Because of my past contributions to the Tokyo esports community the event organizers gave me full creative license to oversea the creation of their logo and press kit.
