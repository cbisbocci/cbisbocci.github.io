The Covid-19 pandemic hit many communities across the world hard, and esports was no exception. Packed arenas and local smashfests alike became unthinkably risky.
In response, the majority of esporting events moved online.

## Corona Nights Takes the Stage!
I've always been close with the event organizers at [TokyoSSB](https://twitter.com/TokyoSSB_EN). I made their first organzation and event logos/press kits. Naturally when they began hosting their new online event, Corona Nights, it was no surprise that they asked me to come up with a new event logo and brand assets.

I took up the task with relish and designed the new [logo and banner for Corona Nights](https://smash.gg/tournament/corona-nights-12/details). In addition to a new stream overlay set and stinger transistion fitting for the esports organization so close to my heart.
