In a recent commission I was hired by a client to create a komodo dragon dual-wielding the Monado Sword from Xenoblade Chronicles, and the Yato from Fire Emblem: Fates. 
This commission was a surprising request since I had yet to have a client request such a creative piece. However working on such a creative piece was invigorating and I enjoyed this project tremendously.
Here's to you Komodo, cheers!
