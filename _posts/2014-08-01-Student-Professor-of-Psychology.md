During my time as a student professor of psychology, I was responsible for designing engaging lesson plans for the lab section of PSY 201 with 10 classes of ~30 students each.
Each week, students would attend the main PSY 201 lecture, given in a 400-person auditorium. By its very nature, a 400-person lecture hall makes it difficult for students to engage with the abstract ideas taught in the course.
For this reason, I was brought on as a student professor and during my two years in the role, I led engaging lab experiments to help make the concepts taught in the lecture portion more memorable.
I am grateful to have been a part of the program since its launch. Based on the feedback I received from my students, our lab sections and the program as a whole was an effective supplement to the main lectures.
The program enjoyed continued success during my tenure and well after my graduation.
