## Christmas Cards
It's that time of year again! The season to spread the love and good cheer with warm cocoa and Yuletide greetings!
And there is no better way to do so than to share the gift of original christmas cards! In this spirt I crafted some seasonally themed cards!

## The Call for Nostalgia
In the digital age social networks facilitate every facet of communication, including the way that we greet each other during the holidays.
In spite of the bells and whistles of modernity, still we long for times past. Almost as if we are [addicted to our past](https://networks.h-net.org/node/2622/discussions/121989/call-papers-pop-nostalgia-uses-past-popular-culture)
Though it's true that ["You can never go home"](https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-331489128/you-can-t-go-home-again-thomas-wolfe-s-vision-of) crafting these cards was in it's own way my exercise in reliving my past. As I expanded pathways and fixed lines I couldn't help but imagine my friends and relatives
opening up these Christmas cards. It took me back to a time when my family would sit around the table, open cards together and reflect
on the year's relationships.
Now that I look back on the my projects from the past year, making Christmas cards became my most intrinsically motivating and rewarding project ^-^
