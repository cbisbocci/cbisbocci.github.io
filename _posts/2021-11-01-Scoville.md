Scoville, a fantastic technology consultation company, asked me to update the content for their corporate website in addition to the site of their sister group RECCOO.
After onboarding I found that I really enjoyed working with my new teammates at Scoville. During my contract I learned a lot from working with the engineers and my
fellow designers as well. With pleasure I set to the task of building a content strategy that they could use as a foundation moving forward. 
From there I completed the necessary research and built out the content for their corporate pages.

Scoville is an innovative consultation group who I would highly recommend to anyone looking for digital solutions, especially for those related to web and AI.
You can check out their website and related company groups below.
