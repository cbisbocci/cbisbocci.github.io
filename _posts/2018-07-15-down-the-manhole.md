Once in a while we all fall down into our personal manholes. It was in the pit of my undergraduate research years that I co-authored my own adventure of going _Down The Manhole_ with my dear friend and illustrator Louis Cicalese. I wrote the story while Cicalese brought the plot to life with his unique illustrative flair.

_Down The Manhole_ was a success amongst my peers and was published in the the Emerald [Scholar's Bank]

At its essence _Down The Manhole_ is the story about a mother, Beatrix, and her son Enzo as they find their way in the world together. 
Given their dysfunctional beginnings this story is not uncommon, but what is remarkable is its ability to break barriers. 
As it currently stands the majority of academic knowledge is allocated to a state of privileged seclusion, 
and the findings that come out of research in the field of child psychology are no exception. 
_Down The Manhole_ is a manifesto which declares accessibility of knowledge to be a basic human right. 
It accomplishes this goal by making research and theories about child development accessible, and comprehensible to the layperson. 
The novel is informed by a combination of symbols of mindfulness, and motifs of developmental theory in order to weave engaging characters,and a compelling plot, that serves to educate the reader about developmental theory. 
Throughout the narrative a large emphasis is placed on the restorative properties of mindfulness as a path to greater health and well-being.


Because _Down The Manhole_ is a project that seeks to inform readers on the subject of developmental psychology I have release a free PDF available for download from the [UO Scholar Bank](https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/handle/1794/20265). This is the original file which contains a lengthy thesis justifying the project, however a more digestible version of _Down The Manhole_ will soon be available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) in both paperback and e-reader versions.
