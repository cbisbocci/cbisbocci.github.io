Everyone once in a while we all fall down into our personal manholes. It was in the pit of my own personal manhole that I co-authored
Down The Manhole with Illustrator Louis Cicalese.

At its essence Down The Manhole is the story about a mother, Beatrix, and her son Enzo as they find their way in the world together. 
Given their dysfunctional beginnings this story is not uncommon, but what is remarkable is its ability to break barriers. 
As it currently stands the majority of academic knowledge is allocated to a state of privileged seclusion, 
and the findings that come out of research in the field of child psychology are no exception. 
Down The Manhole is a manifesto which declares accessibility of knowledge to be a basic human right. 
It accomplishes this goal by making research and theories about child development accessible, and comprehensible to the layperson. 
The novel is informed by a combination of symbols of mindfulness, and motifs of developmental theory in order to weave engaging characters,
and a compelling plot, that serves to educate the reader about developmental theory. 
Throughout the narrative a large emphasis is placed on the restorative properties of mindfulness as a path to greater health and well-being.

Down The Manhole will soon be available on Amazon (https://www.amazon.com/) in both paperback and e-reader versions.
