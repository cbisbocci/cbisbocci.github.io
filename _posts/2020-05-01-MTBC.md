Mt. Takao Base Camp began as a startup in the October 0f 2019. This was a really cool experience for me because I was able to ply my content expertise and mold a business
from the ground up. My work with the Base Camp began before the launch in October. I worked to ensure the fluency of all our English content, digital and physical.
Additionally I directed our social media efforts as the team lead. During my time at the Base I learned a lot from working with the other experts on our team and learned
how to build a social network from the ground-up. Mt. Takao Base Camp is a lovely resort nestled at the foot of Mt. Takao and the surrounding mountain ranges. 
I would highly recommend checking out the Base next time you visit the Takao area.
