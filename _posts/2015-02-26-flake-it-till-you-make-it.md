## Tokyo SSB
Tokyo SSB is the premier grassroots community for competitive Super Smash Brothers play for non-Japanese speakers in Tokyo.  When I first arrived in Tokyo I found no information in English about the competitive scene here so I start began hosting events for this group through [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Tokyo-Super-Smash-Bros/).

After the meetup group surpassed 300 members it became clear that the group needed to expand its social media presence.  From there I collaborated with three other friends to grow our community on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/GnJhYKx) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tokyo_ssb)

## VODS
How do you get better at your favorite sport? Ask any competitor and they will list **performance review** as one of their top five reasons everytime.To this end Tokyo SSB began recording and livestreaming our weekly tournaments on the [Tokyo SSB Twitch page](https://www.twitch.tv/tokyossb). After tournaments I clipped the livestreams, trimmed and editted thumbnails in Photoshop and Illustrator, before uploading them to the [Tokyo SSB youtube account](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1hu0RXTWBkkhN116BxpvcQ). This process took me about 3-4 hours to complete after hosting the meetup each week. I did so with the hope to attract new players to the group, and give current members to improve their gameplay by having the opportunity to review. 

## Looking Forward
Starting on Nintendo will release their newest installment in the series, [Smash Ultimate](https://www.smashbros.com/en_US/). At that time, Tokyo SSB expects to see an innundation of interest in the competitive scene and new players eager to prove themselves in our weekly tournaments.
