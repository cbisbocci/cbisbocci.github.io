I began writing for Prescott Papers in 2014 as a Psychology student at a liberal arts college. Prescott Papers
gave me the perfect opportunity to hone the writing skills I was learning at school. I entered into the company
as a part-time writer but over time advanced my position within the company to that of a editorial management role.
It was at Prescott that I learned some of the fundamental skills that would later serve as the foundation of my content career. 
As an on-demand writer I took on many projects that touched on all aspects of the written word. I often worked on academic, technical, creative writing projects.
Later as the company grew, and I with it, I took on the role of team lead and began managing our academic writing team.
