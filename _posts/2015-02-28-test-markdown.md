_The Shakeybanks Project_ is an exercise in community building through character creation and SNS mobilization.  The character himself started as a long-form improv exercise. What was originally meant to be a one-off character for an afternoon session of [_Fiasco_](http://bullypulpitgames.com/games/fiasco/), later blossomed into a fully-fleshed out persona whom I built corresponding [twitter](https://twitter.com/ShakeyBanks), [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/shakeybanks) [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN2CZDAXncFoTVjPMCGV2ug) and [discord](https://discord.gg/GnJhYKx ) communities around.


You can write regular [markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) here and Jekyll will automatically convert it to a nice webpage.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](http://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg)

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.
