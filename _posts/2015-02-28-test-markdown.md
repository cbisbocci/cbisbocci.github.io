_The Shakeybanks Project_ is an exercise in community building through character creation and SNS mobilization.  Shakey himself was born of a long-form improv exercise. What was originally meant to be a one-off character for an afternoon session of [_Fiasco_](http://bullypulpitgames.com/games/fiasco/), later blossomed into a fully-fleshed out persona whom I built corresponding [twitter](https://twitter.com/ShakeyBanks), [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/shakeybanks) [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN2CZDAXncFoTVjPMCGV2ug) and [discord](https://discord.gg/GnJhYKx ) communities around.

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
