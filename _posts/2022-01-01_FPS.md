Flex Point Security is Toronto's premiere security consultant and provider. We provide static and mobile guards for every occassion in addition to CCTV installation and monitoring.
Initially I worked with FPS as a contractor to troubleshoot UX related issues on their legacy site. Eventually our partnership grew and I was brought onto the team to spearhead 
the website redesign as their lead UX product architect. Currently I lead our design team's content strategy, UX and visual design
in the charge to work hand in glove with our adminstrators, corporate stakeholders, developers and media strategy team; all with the goal to grow FPS at scale.
