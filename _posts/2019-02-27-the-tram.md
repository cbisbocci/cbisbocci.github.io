As a designer it is essential to maximize image-impact, while minimizing turnover time.  
In order to sharpen my skills in this particular area I occassionally enter design contests, and time myself to create a quality submission, in as little time as possible.  Below is my recent submission to The Tram, a fictional shorts publication that circulates through the larger Hokuriku area. The theme of the contest was "Creative". After giving it some thought I conceived a cover that took inspiration from the way that neural cascades function in the brain, and finished the design in under two hours.

I streamlined my work flow through Illustrator initially to create the vector shapes that would later become the neurons that I would later duplicate and layer in Photoshop. Text and and the 3D effect were also added at this time. 

After the deadline passed The Tram's submission board told me that choose another design for that month's cover. However I now have a better idea of what the board is looking for next time, and the lessons that I learned in streamlining my workflow were invaluable.
