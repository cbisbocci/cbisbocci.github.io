POPOFF! is a major Tokyo esporting event.
The event planned to accomodate 400 competitors from all parts of Japan and abroad to compete in a double-elimination Super Smash Brothers bracket. An event of this undertaking is huge, and I was asked to coordinate the social media campaign, as well as to design the official POPOFF! logo and social media campaign press kit.

## Designing POPOFF!
POPOFF is by far one of the projects that I had the most fun working on. Because of my past contributions to the Tokyo esports community the event organizers gave me full creative license to oversee the creation of their logo and press kit. There was some special energy surrounding this event, and I found myself really synergizing with our promotion team. Gaijin Gaming Bros were resposible for creating a [hype trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oR2CECnT40M) for the event, while I built the press kit. Together we created a campaign and launch schedule and within eight weeks we managed to bolster our social media presence and fill the waitlist for the event.

## Promotional Posters

The organizers knew that if they wanted anyone to come out that the social media team would have to let our audience know that big names will attending. Once the orginizers had secured a celebrity athlete's attendance I created a promotional poster to post on Twitter. This way everyone would know all the big names that would be in attendence for POPOFF, thus guranteeing registrations.
Below are the promotional posters I designed for POPOFF:
